2012-03-16  Charles Kerr  <charles.kerr@canonical.com>

	fix memory leak updating the username label -- gtk_label_set_text() takes a const char*, we don't need to g_strdup() the string before passing it in

2012-03-16  Charles Kerr  <charles.kerr@canonical.com>

	plug two more memory leaks. g_variant_get("s") makes a newly-allocated duplicated string, g_variant_get("&s") returns the internal const string.

2012-03-16  Charles Kerr  <charles.kerr@canonical.com>

2012-03-08  Michael Vogt  <michael.vogt@ubuntu.com>

	src/apt-watcher.c: remove no longer needed code, this RestartRequired is a bit misleading as it about that the PK daemon got restarted not about system or session

2012-03-08  Michael Vogt  <michael.vogt@ubuntu.com>

	src/apt-watcher.c: check the pk_results_get_require_restart_worst() in get_updates() too

	Make GUDev optional for arch's that can't support it

2012-02-23  Ted Gould  <ted@gould.cx>

	Making sure to distribute the files even if we don't use them to build.

2012-02-23  Evgeni Golov  <evgeni@debian.org>

	make gudev dep optional
	
	Debian has arches w/o udev (hurd-*, kfreebsd-*). These cannot build
	indicator-session currently because libgudev-1.0-dev is missing there.
	Make the gudev dep optional and thus make indicator-session buildable on
	non-Linux arches again.

	merge roberts lock fix

2012-02-10  Robert Ancell  <robert.ancell@canonical.com>

	Don't lock the session when switching to another one - something else (ConsoleKit?) already does this and locks it regardless of if the setting has been configured.
	By explicitly doing the lock it means we can't override it inside GNOME screensaver to switch to the greeter instead, so this patch removes the code.

2009-07-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Executing the helper, but it needs to be the one in the libexec path.

2009-07-22  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Make a dialog pop up.  Not really the right one, but one.

2009-07-22  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching to having a single handler and then everyone calling it with a parameter.

	Ignoring some autogenerated files.

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Moving the server to after the items makes things work better, but I'm curious why it's failing.  This is more a test for dbusmenu though which'll have better debug.

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Getting some menuitems

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some debugging info.

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Showing the loading item.  Atleast that works now.

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Bah, I hate pointers some days.

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Trying to flesh out the add function some more, but this commit doesn't build as apparently switches have to have integers now.  This takes half of the fun out of C if you can't use crazy function pointers everywhere!  Where's the sport in readable code?

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching over the status menu too.  Woot!

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in stuff for the users menu.  Getting better at this.

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Working more on changing the style of how things work for clients.  This is the session based items.

2009-06-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Showing the added menu and adding in a loading item.

2009-06-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oh, the signal is 'add' not 'added'.  How I love to have random strings without checking, all the elegance of Python.

2009-06-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fleshing out the insertion function.  Let's get some menus.

2009-06-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Bubbling up the position information to a final function to put things on the main menu.

2009-06-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in separators

2009-06-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Splitting out the menu loading and process starting code to make it lazy and push it into the idle loop.  No blocking DBus on startup.

2009-06-16  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Building the service files more correctly.

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, we need functions as we want a list of icons.

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	A quickly little object to put itself on DBus.

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Brining in the client side of the API

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Actually the client is the indicator.  Silly to have one binary be both client and server, heh.

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a DBus interface for the status specific stuff

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some comments describing the intentions of the functions.

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Putting in the status translation tables.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a proxy to start gettin' us some Pidgin

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oops, what a mess up. But this sure makes things unhappy.  Nasty to debug segfault.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, let's use these providers.  We're 733t now.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Starting to connect things together.  Let's get some Pidgin in there.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Now we're setting the status provider functions of the StatusProvider interface.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Preliminary pidgin wrappers.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a good ol' signal handler and even emits this puppy.  Whew.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some public funtions and now they can be subclassed

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Don't need a private or dispose or finalize.  This class is more of an interface.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Moving the enum into the provider object and changing the name everywhere.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Providing the first hints at an API

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in the basic (generated) framework for the status provider object

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oops, forgot about invisible.  I guess that's kinda expected though, as it's invisible.

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Connecting in a callback.

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Building the menuitems

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Using the defines and strings that were in our patches to FUSA.  I wrote the code, so it is like other things © Canonical so there is no issue there.  There is other code in FUSA that is not.

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making sure to clean up the generated service files.  Whew.  Pass distcheck.

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in the DBus services directory with localinstall support

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a configure flag so that indicators can be installed locally for distcheck purposes.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Copying that code into the other two services.  Now we're dbus-y.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Bringing up a dbusmenu item.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding more dependencies and cflags and stuff to make the builds of the services more complete

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oh, stealing the methods used in PolicyKit for building these.  I dislike calling sed directly, but the results are fantastic.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a bunch of service files.  We're hip now.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Now we're building services.  Snazy.

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Renaming the C file as well.

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Changing the name to get rid of FUSA, which doesn't really make sense anymore.

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making things into a set of three user-daemons.

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching the pkgconfig based directory.

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Changing the build stuff for ye ol' fusa indicator

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in new deps and a version bump

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging from trunk.  Splitting out packaging and getting all the files.

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Removing packaing from trunk

2009-06-08  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Heh, forgot to put that file in.

2008-12-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Ignoring

2008-12-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Actually getting this all to build reasonably.
