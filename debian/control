Description: Ayatana Indicator showing session management, status and user switching
 This Ayatana Indicator is designed to be placed on the right side of a
 panel and give the user easy control for changing their instant message
 status.   Switching to another user.  Starting a guest session.  Or
 controlling the status of their own session.
 .
 It requires some way to be hosted into a panel. For the MATE Panel the
 appropriate package is mate-indicator-applet. For the Xfce Panel the
 appropriate package is xfce4-indicator-plugin.
